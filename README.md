# Treble Website

Hello Future Treble Technical Director!

My name is Derek, I was once the Treble Technical Director, but now I am once
upon a Treble.  I am writing this to explain the features of the Treble website.

The website is hosted on my webserver, but is automatically updated via FTP
through a GitHub web hook.  Any push to the master branch is automatically
copied into the web directory, so be careful what you push to master.

I have also written a Gulp script to simplify many of the recurring processes,
like compiling sass and compressing images.  To use it, simply install and
run the gulp command in the project directory.

The website is built using UIKit, which is similar to Bootstrap, except
substantially more lightweight, allowing me to add all of the custom themes
that exist in this website.  Custom theming is written in SCSS, in the "./sass"
folder.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

Treble Love,

DerekBro
