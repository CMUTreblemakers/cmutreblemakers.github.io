# Treble Website

Hello Future Treble Technical Director!

My name is Derek, I was once the Treble Technical Director, but now I am once
upon a Treble.  I am writing this to explain the features of the Treble website.

- The treble domain is registered on GoDaddy, paid for by the University.  This is where DNS managment is performed.
- The site itself is hosted using GitHub pages (ie cmutreblemakers.github.io) using a custom domain.
  - I have written a Gulp script to simplify many of the recurring processes,
like compiling sass and compressing images.  To use it, simply install and
run the gulp command in the project directory.

  - The website is built using UIKit, which is similar to Bootstrap, except
substantially more lightweight, allowing me to add all of the custom themes
that exist in this website.  Custom theming is written in SCSS, in the "./sass"
folder.

- The audition portal (ie audition.cmutreblemakers.com) is an instance of the Audition application (source code inside the org).  However, since it requires PHP, it is hosted on my personal web server.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

Treble Love,

Derekbro
